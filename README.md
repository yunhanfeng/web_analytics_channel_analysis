# web_analytics_channel_analysis
With dataset of retailer's transaction data, which contains data of different channels/touch points worth analyzing, I conducted funnel analysis to see which channels bring the most conversion. 

E-commerce website data for user journey is always a fascinating topic for me. The dataset is much cleaner and much insight can be generated from the analysis, and in the end, it might lead to identifying converter and increase conversion rate.

The detailed walk-through of analysis is put in my [Medium post](https://medium.com/@henryfeng/customer-funnel-analysis-for-online-retailer-using-pivot-table-and-clustering-in-python-bdcc88824d0b). Feel free to check it out.
